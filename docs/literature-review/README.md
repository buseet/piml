# PIML Literature Review

This directory contains a comprehensive review of Physics-Informed Machine Learning literature, organised into five thematic matrices. Each matrix focuses on a specific aspect of PIML research and applications.

## Organisation

The literature is organised into the following matrices:

1. **[Core PIML Papers](01-core-piml.md)**: Foundational work on PINNs, neural operators, Bayesian PINNs, and domain decomposition methods

2. **[Image/Vision Integration](02-image-vision.md)**: Methods for integrating computer vision with physics, extracting physical quantities from images, and inverse problems from visual data

3. **[Oceanography & Bathymetry](03-oceanography.md)**: Domain-specific applications in ocean physics, wave modelling, bathymetry inversion, and satellite remote sensing

4. **[Bayesian Methods & Gaussian Processes](04-bayesian-methods.md)**: Probabilistic approaches, uncertainty quantification, Gaussian processes, and constrained inference

5. **[Software, Tools & Tutorials](05-tools-software.md)**: Frameworks, libraries, codebases, and educational resources for implementing PIML methods

## How to Use This Review

### Matrix Structure

Each matrix includes:

- **Bibliographic Information**: Authors, year, publication
- **Technical Details**: Problem type, methods, architecture, etc.
- **Key Contributions**: Main innovations and findings
- **Results & Performance**: Quantitative outcomes where available
- **Limitations**: Known issues or constraints
- **Relevance Assessment**: Why this paper matters for specific applications

### Navigation Tips

**By Research Goal:**

- Developing new PIML methods → Start with [Core PIML](01-core-piml.md)
- Working with image/satellite data → See [Image/Vision](02-image-vision.md)
- Domain applications → Check [Oceanography](03-oceanography.md)
- Need uncertainty quantification → Explore [Bayesian Methods](04-bayesian-methods.md)
- Implementation questions → Review [Tools & Software](05-tools-software.md)

**By Experience Level:**

- **Beginners**: Start with [Tools & Tutorials](05-tools-software.md), then [Core PIML](01-core-piml.md)
- **Practitioners**: Focus on [Tools & Software](05-tools-software.md) and domain-specific matrices
- **Researchers**: Review all matrices, prioritising high-relevance (4-5) papers

## Citation Format

Papers are cited informally in the matrices for readability. For formal citations, please refer to the original publications. A BibTeX compilation may be added in future updates.
